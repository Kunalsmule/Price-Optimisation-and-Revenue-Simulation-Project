# Price-Optimisation-and-Revenue-Simulation-Project
Overview

Many companies struggle to set optimal product prices due to fluctuating demand, promotions, seasonality, and competitive pressures. Incorrect pricing can lead to lost revenue or reduced market share. This project addresses these challenges by analyzing historical sales data to compute price elasticity, recommend optimal prices, and simulate revenue impact.

Problem Statement

Companies often lack insight into how price changes affect product demand.

Seasonal trends and promotions are not always incorporated into pricing strategies.

Manual pricing decisions can be inefficient and lead to suboptimal revenue.

Project Objective

1. Calculate price elasticity for each product using historical sales and pricing data.

2. Generate recommended prices that optimize revenue based on elasticity and product characteristics.

3. Include promotions and seasonality in analysis for more accurate demand modeling.

4. Simulate projected revenue impact to inform actionable pricing decisions.

5. Provide interactive visualizations for easy interpretation and portfolio presentation.

Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing: Loaded historical sales data, handled missing values, and created seasonality features (month, week, day).

2. Elasticity Calculation: Used regression models incorporating price, discounts, and seasonal factors to calculate product-level price elasticity.

3. Price Recommendations: Determined optimal price changes based on elasticity, with consideration for inelastic and elastic products.

4. Revenue Simulation: Projected revenue before and after recommended price changes to identify high-impact products.

5. Interactive Visualizations: Created plots for elasticity, recommended price comparisons, and revenue changes to make insights clear and actionable.
